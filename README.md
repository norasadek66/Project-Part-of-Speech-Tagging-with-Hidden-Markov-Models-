# Part of Speech Tagging
# ======================    #                           
# This is the final project required by Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. 
In this project, I built a hidden markov model (HMM) to perform part of speech tagging, a common prepocessing step in natural language processing.
## Implementation
In this notebook, I used1 the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.
